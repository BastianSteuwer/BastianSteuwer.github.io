I am a Post-Doc at the [Center for Population-Level Bioethics](https://cplb.rutgers.edu/) at Rutgers University. Before that I finished my PhD from the [London School of Economics](http://wwww.lse.ac.uk/philosophy). My research interests are in moral, political, and legal philosophy.

My current work divides into three projects. The first project is on the *ethics of risk*. In the past, I have worked on a contractualist account of risk imposition. More recently, I have started thinking about the ethics of risk in clinical research in particular in connection with the coronavirus pandemic. The second project is on the *fair allocation of health care*. In this project I seek to connect my previous work on aggregation with questions of priority-setting and rationing in health care. The third project is on *discrimination*. This project spans across ideas of discrimination in legal philosophy and ideas of discrimination in applied ethics, such as disability discrimination in health care.

My [PhD dissertation](http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/4149/) focused on the importance of the separateness of persons. I argued for a relational understanding of the separateness of persons that supports a broadly contractualist account of morality. In the dissertation, I apply this understanding of the separateness of persons to questions of distributive justice, risk, aggregation, and deontological constraints. I also argue that the separateness of persons matters to morality even if our personal identity should not matter to us rationally.

Here is my [CV](_pages/CV Public 25 August 2020.pdf). You can see short descriptions of my research below.

  <p>The design of human challenge studies balances scientific validity, efficiency, and study safety. We explore some advantages and disadvantages of “low-dosage” challenge studies, in the setting of testing second-generation vaccines against COVID-19. Compared to a conventional vaccine challenge, a low-dosage vaccine challenge would be likelier to start, and start earlier. A low-dosage challenge would also be less likely to rule out a vaccine candidate which would have been potentially effectivein target usage. A key ethical advantage of a low-dosage challenge over conventional challengeis that both it and its dose escalation process are safer for each participant. Low-dosage studies usually require larger numbers of participants than conventional challenges, but this and other potential disadvantages are less serious than they may initially appear. Overall, low-dosage challenges should be considered for certain roles, such as prioritizing between second-generation vaccines against COVID-19.</p>

  <p>Limited aggregation is the view that when deciding whom to save we sometimes are allowed to pay attention to the relative numbers involved and sometimes we are not. Limited aggregation is motivated by a powerful idea: our decision whom to save should respect each person’s separate claim to our help; in particular it should respect those in need whose claims are the greatest. Recent work has provided strong challenges to such a view and shown that current proposal of limited aggregation have serious flaws. I argue for a new version of limited aggregation Hybrid Balance Relevant Claims which is well-grounded in the reasons we have to be skeptical of aggregation and avoids these challenges.</p>

  <p>How should contractualists assess the permissibility of risky actions? Both, ex ante and ex post contractualism, fail to distinguish between different kinds of risk. I argue that this overlooks a third alternative, 'objective ex ante contractualism' that discounts complaints by objective risks rather than by epistemic risks. I argue that we should adopt this view since it provides us with the best model of justifiability to each.</p>

  <p>Derek Parfit famously argued that personal identity is not what matters for prudential concerns. He further claimed that his view on personal identity has profound implications for moral theory. It should lead us, among other things, to deny the separateness of persons. I argue that Parfit is mistaken about this inference. His revisionary arguments about personal identity and rationality have no implications for moral theory.</p>
